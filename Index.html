<h1 style="text-align:center;">Activities I did this Summer</h1>



<br>
<li><b>Visted my grandma</b></li>
<p>I visted my grandma's house, but it is more like staying over for a week, with my cousins.
<br> We did some yard work for them (well tried), but very little of it because we were on our games almost the entire day. We were up almost the entire night for all 5 days, Playing games and being loud. <br>
We also played with our grandma's dog, we ran with him in the yard. When we were done both our grandparents told me and my brothers and cousins stories about them and their kids. My grandmom also Published her new book and the second book, the first one is called "When you know better you do better".
<br>
<li><b>Walking & Basket ball</b></li>

<p>My mom was doing a competition with her cousin, sisters and friends. The competition was about who could burn the most calories in a certain time period. So we began going to parks and trails more frequently, some times my aunt, brought her childern(our cousins).<br>
We would play basket ball and joke aroud while our parents walked, and when we felt like it we walked with them sometimes, but back to the competition, when it was over my mom got first place with over<br>
7,000 calories burned. She is still going and exercising even though the competition is over, so we go to parks and trails more frequently.</p>

<li><b>Played Games</b></li>
<p>When the summer began me and my siblings began to play games more frequently. On Some days we played from the early morning till midnight, but we did take a few brakes. The games we played were really fun and made time fly by, When we woke up around 9:00am we played our games for a short time, well we thought it was a short time, but when the short time was over it was 4:00pm. Thats is after school ends,and schools feels like it's forever.</p>
